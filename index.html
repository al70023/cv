  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>
    I am fourth-year engineering student at Texas A&M University.
    I enjoy playing soccer, dancing, and coding.
  </p>

  <p style="margin: 0;">
    I am taking CSCE 447 because I want to learn more about data visualizations and their
    applications in industry.
  </p>
  <p style="margin: 0;">
    With the prominence of data science nowadays, it is extremely important to make sense of the
    vast amount of information we have at our disposal.</p>
  <p style="margin: 0;">
    Every industry domain needs to effectively interpret some form of statistics,
    and I want to grow my skills in this area to make myself more marketable,
    flexible, and adaptable to various fields.

  <h3>Good Data Visualization Example</h3>
  <p>
    One data visualization I find particularly helpful is 
    <a href="https://www.maharam.com/stories/sherlock_florence-nightingales-rose-diagram">
      Florence Nightingale's Rose Chart.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    I really like how simple it is to visualize the comparison between different attributes 
    in this type of chart. Instead of comparing things side by side, overlaying them in this
    fashion makes it very easy to see the difference, in this case, between causes of death, 
    per each month. This type of chart is often used in sports analysis now, because 
    it makes comparing different attributes very simple and all together without making the 
    eyes have to wander around.

  <h3>Bad Data Visualization Example</h3>
  <p>
    One bad data visualization I consider unhelpful and misleading is
    <a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.codeconquest.com/wp-content/uploads/image-12.png?w=680&ssl=1">
      this bar chart from Fox News on the percentage of Americans who identify as Christian.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon first looking at this chart, a viewer might believe that the right bar shows a halving from the
    left. However, the y-axis is truncated. A bar chart should also begin the y-axis at 0, to maintain
    proper scale. Starting this chart at 58% means that the difference on the top end is visually 
    exaggerated, and can seriously mislead viewers into believing a change between the two data points 
    is much larger than in reality.
